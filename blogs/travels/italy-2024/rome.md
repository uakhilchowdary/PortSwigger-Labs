# Rome Highlights

Rome, the Eternal City, is a living museum with thousands of years of history around every corner. Here are some highlights from our visit to this magnificent city.

## The Colosseum

The iconic symbol of Rome, the Colosseum is a testament to ancient Roman engineering and architecture. Built between 70-80 AD, this massive amphitheater could hold up to 80,000 spectators who came to watch gladiatorial contests and other public spectacles.

Walking through the arches and standing in the arena where gladiators once fought was an awe-inspiring experience. The history is palpable, and you can almost hear the roar of the crowd echoing through time.

## Vatican City

Though technically a separate country, no visit to Rome is complete without exploring Vatican City. St. Peter's Basilica is simply breathtaking in its scale and artistic beauty. The dome, designed by Michelangelo, offers panoramic views of Rome for those willing to climb the 551 steps.

The Vatican Museums house an incredible collection of art, but the highlight has to be the Sistine Chapel. Michelangelo's ceiling frescoes depicting scenes from the Book of Genesis are even more impressive in person than in photographs.

## Roman Forum

Walking through the Roman Forum feels like stepping back in time. This was once the center of Roman public life, housing government buildings, temples, and marketplaces.

The ruins that remain give you a sense of what daily life might have been like in ancient Rome. Standing before the Temple of Saturn or the Arch of Titus connects you to a civilization that existed thousands of years ago.

## Trevi Fountain

The Baroque masterpiece that is the Trevi Fountain was completed in 1762. The tradition says that if you throw a coin over your shoulder into the fountain, you'll ensure your return to Rome someday.

Visiting at night when the fountain is illuminated provides a magical experience away from the daytime crowds.

## Pasta and Gelato

No trip to Rome would be complete without mentioning the food! Authentic Roman pasta dishes like Carbonara, Cacio e Pepe, and Amatriciana are simple but bursting with flavor.

And the gelato! We tried a different flavor every day, from classic pistachio to rich chocolate. The perfect treat while wandering the cobblestone streets on a warm Italian afternoon.
